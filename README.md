# Haskell Language support

Support for the Haskell programming language in visual studio code.

## Highlighting

Adds highlighting support for Haskell (.hs and .lhs) based on the [Haskell TextMate bundle](https://github.com/textmate/haskell.tmbundle) and Cabal files (.cabal) via a concoction of my own. 

Also adds automatic indentation after `where`, `do`, `->` etc. and surrounding brackets (`[]`, `{}` etc)

Includes common Haskell code snippets, such as `data` and `newtype` declarations, main module, `if` and `case`.
